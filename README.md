# Random Bash Scripts 

These are Random bash scripts that I have written. Just a way for me to learn bash and make scripts to automate reptatitive tasks. I am no 
bash wizard and do all my learning from over here :
[Pure bash bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible)
Do check it out if you want to make your own bash script. *DON'T* trust gpt with making scripts for you unless you know exactly what it does 
(call me paranoid but I dont trust it)

## The bash scripts mainly include :
- jj-clean :
    git clean but for jujutsu based repos. It still doesnt have the -i or -f functionality as git does. Also it only removes gitignore files and not untracked files (since jujutsu doesnt really have the concept of untracked as every change is a commit).
